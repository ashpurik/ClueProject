1) There were multiple files with the same name but containing different content.
So we renamed them and moved them so all the files were in the same folder.

2) We moved methods around so that the constructors and getters and setters were
at the top of the page and the Board methods were after that. 

3) We changed doorwayWorks so there is not an if statement inside of another if
statement (all in one if statement)

4) Fixed all indentations throughout code so it is easier to read

5) Added short comments after testing code to make sure we know what is going on
